This project was the final project for my data science 2 course. It trains on labeled images of
pokemon and digimon, and then predicts whether new images are pokemon or digimon.

I am pretty proud of this project, it is just a basic image classifier but I built it while under
a lot of stress with other classes and finals hitting at the same time, while it was supposed to
be a three person project I was the only one in my group who had not dropped the class or ghosted.

If I were to redo this project, I would leave the core components the same, but would try to optimize
the results with calibrations in the number of layers and size of each layer. I would also try to
get the GraphCAM evaluation model to work, as I had issues trying to attach it to the final layers
of the prediction model without matrix dimension mismatches.
